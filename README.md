#Machine Learning for Trading

I completed these projects in Spring 2017 for the purpose of CS46464, Machine Learning for Trading. An in-depth explanation of each project can be found at this website: <br>

I enjoyed this class because it taught me a lot of valuable Machine Learning knowledge as well as the fundamentals of Technical Analysis.
