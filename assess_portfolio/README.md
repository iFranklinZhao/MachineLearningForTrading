#Assess Portfolio

For this project, I implemented a function that takes in a description of a portfolio and computes the appropriate statistics on that portfolio. <br>

Each portfolio has: start date, end date, symbols for stocks, allocations, and a starting portfolio value of $1000000. <br>

I calculated the: daily portfolio value, cumulative return, average daily return, standard deviation of daily returns, Sharpe ratio of the overall portfolio, and ending value of portfolio. <br>

The purpose of this first project is to get acclimated to using pandas dataframes and learning the basic evaluation methods and implementations for portfolio analysis. <br>
